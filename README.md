OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this project is to analyze IT Help Desk ticket data to understand issue patterns, ticket workload, priority distribution, and resolution performance.
The analysis aims to highlight areas where operational efficiency can be improved using data-driven insights.

DATASET:
The dataset used in this project contains IT Help Desk ticket information, including:
Ticket ID
Issue Category
Priority Level
Ticket Status
Created Date
Resolved Date
Resolution Time
The same dataset was used across Excel, SQL, and Power BI to maintain consistency throughout the analysis.

TOOLS USED:
1. Microsoft Excel – data importing, cleaning, and preparation
2. SQL – structured querying and analysis
3. Power BI – interactive dashboards and visual analysis

ANALYSIS WORKFLOW:
1. Excel – Data Cleaning & Preparation
 Imported raw IT Help Desk data
 Checked for missing, duplicate, and inconsistent values
 Cleaned and formatted the dataset
 Created pivot tables and basic charts for initial exploration

2. SQL – Data Analysis
 Loaded the cleaned dataset into a SQL database
 Used SQL queries to analyze:
 Ticket count by category and priority
 Open vs resolved tickets
 Average resolution time
 Ticket trends over time

3. Power BI – Visualization
 Built interactive dashboards to visualize:
 Issue category distribution
 Priority-wise ticket volume
 Ticket status overview
 Resolution time patterns

KEY INSIGHTS:
1. Certain issue categories generated a high volume of tickets
2. High-priority tickets required faster resolution but were fewer in number
3. Ticket volume varied over time, indicating workload fluctuations
4. Some issues consistently took longer to resolve, highlighting improvement areas
