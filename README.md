PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project analyzes IT Help Desk ticket data to understand common issues, ticket volume patterns, priority distribution, and resolution performance.
I worked with the same dataset across Excel, SQL, and Power BI to follow a complete data analysis flow — starting from raw data cleaning, moving to structured analysis, and finally presenting insights through interactive dashboards.
The focus of this project is not just visualization, but understanding how IT support data can be used to identify workload trends, recurring problem areas, and opportunities to improve ticket handling and resolution time.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

- IT support teams handle a large number of tickets every day, but without proper analysis it becomes difficult to:
- Identify the most frequent issue types
- Understand ticket workload trends over time
- Track priority distribution and SLA performance
- Evaluate resolution efficiency
- This project aims to answer these questions using historical help desk ticket data.

DATA SOURCE:

- The dataset contains IT Help Desk ticket records with information such as:
- Ticket category and issue type
- Priority level
- Ticket creation and resolution dates
- Ticket status

TOOLS USED:

- Excel – Data cleaning, basic exploration, and preparation
- SQL – Structured querying and analysis
- Power BI – Interactive dashboards and visual storytelling
- GitHub – Version control and project documentation

ANALYSIS WORKFLOW:

- Data Import & Cleaning (Excel)
- Checked for missing values and inconsistencies
- Standardized categories and priority labels
- Prepared clean data for analysis

DATA ANALYSIS (SQL)

- Analyzed ticket volume trends
- Examined priority distribution
- Evaluated resolution performance and patterns

VISUALIZATION (Power BI)

- Built dashboards to show ticket trends and KPIs
- Highlighted high-priority workload and resolution behavior
- Presented insights in an easy-to-understand format

KEY INSIGHTS:

- Certain issue categories consistently generate higher ticket volumes
- High-priority tickets represent a smaller portion of total tickets but require more resolution effort
- Ticket volume patterns reveal peak workload periods
- Resolution time varies significantly by priority and issue type
