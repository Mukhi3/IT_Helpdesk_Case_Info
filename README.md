OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this project is to analyze IT Help Desk ticket data to understand issue patterns, ticket workload, priority distribution, and resolution performance.
The analysis focuses on identifying trends and problem areas where data-driven insights can support better operational efficiency in IT support teams.

DATASET:
The dataset contains IT Help Desk ticket records, including:
1. Ticket ID
2. Issue category
3. Priority level
4. Ticket status
5. Created and resolved dates
6. Resolution time

(The same dataset was used across Excel, SQL, and Power BI to ensure consistency throughout the analysis workflow.)

TOOLS USED:
1. Microsoft Excel – Data importing, cleaning, and preparation
2. SQL – Structured querying and analytical exploration
3. Power BI – Interactive dashboards and visual analysis

ANALYSIS WORKFLOW:

1. Excel – Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Imported raw IT Help Desk ticket data
- Identified and handled missing, duplicate, and inconsistent values
- Standardized fields such as issue categories and priorities
- Used pivot tables and charts for initial data exploration

2. SQL – Data Analysis
- Loaded the cleaned dataset into a SQL database
- Used SQL queries to analyze:
- Ticket count by category and priority
- Open vs resolved ticket distribution
- Average resolution time
- Ticket trends over time

3. Power BI – Visualization
- Built interactive dashboards to visualize:
- Issue category distribution
- Priority-wise ticket volume
- Ticket status overview
- Resolution time patterns

KEY INSIGHTS:
- Certain issue categories generated a consistently high volume of tickets
- High-priority tickets were fewer in number but required faster resolution
- Ticket volume varied over time, indicating workload fluctuations
- Some issue types consistently took longer to resolve, highlighting areas for process improvement
